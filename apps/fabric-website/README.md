# [Fabric website](http://dev.office.com/fabric)

##### The official website for the Offce UI Fabric project.

Office UI Fabric is a collection of projects that represent the Office and Office 365 design language in code. This website helps document, explain, and guide folks to the variety of sub-projects that make up Fabric.

## Build the website

Before you get started, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. To view the documentation including examples, contracts, current statuses, and to add functionality or fix issues locally, you can:

1. `git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react.git` - this is the [Office UI Fabric React project](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) which you will want to name *office-ui-fabric-react*
2. `npm install` the Fabric React project you just cloned in the previous step.
3. In the command prompt change directories to the fabric-website director in apps `cd apps/fabric-website/`.
4. Then to start the website run `npm start`. This will open your operating system's default web browser with the website. You can make changes to the code which will automatically build and refresh the page using live-reload.
