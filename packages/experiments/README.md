# [Office UI Fabric React Experiments](http://dev.microsoft.com/fabric)

##### Experimental components for Office UI Fabric React

These are not production ready components and __should never be used in product__. This experimental space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import experimental components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@uifabric/experiments/lib/ComponentName';
```

Once the experimental component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { ComponentName } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/ComponentName';
```
